Justin's Simple Code Server
Current version V1.0 Beta

A tiny, self-contained Python file server with a VS-Code-like in-browser editor and Discord OAuth authentication.
It lets authorized Discord users browse, preview, download and edit files on the host machine (with configurable permissions).

Quick: this repository contains a single-file HTTP server (e.g. server.py) â€” drop it into a folder you want to serve, configure a few environment variables and run.

Per-user permission model stored in a local SQLite DB

VS Code-style Single Page App (Monaco editor) for editing text files in-browser
